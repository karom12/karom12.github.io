	<h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
    <h3> <a href="https://www.vortex.com/">Vortex</a></h3>
    <p> This website is not CRAP but CRAPPY because no amount of searching can help figure out what this company truly does?.
        It's lack of upkeep is very clearly shown. A blast from the past.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Contrast in the site is nonexistent where everything is brightly colored.</li>
        <li>Repetition can be seen how it uses it's fonts, it's just overly filled with links.</li>
        <li>It is not Aligned properly so it gives it a elementary school did this during recess vibe.</li>
        <li> It lacks Proximity from it's links to regular fonts.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> <a href="https://www.charlotte.edu/">University of North Carolina at Charlotte</a></h3>
    <p> This website is an amazing example of CRAP(the good kind). It changes with the times along with being creative.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Contrast is very noticeable with their use of the school color for the font and background so the words are readable.</li>
        <li>Repetition is out and about with the font colors and how they style information of the school.</li>
        <li>Each area of the site aligned with one another to keep a consistency of information being viewed cleanly.</li>
        <li>Proximity is there where there are headers that catch the readers attention with the change to smaller font for the extended information.</li>
    </ul>
